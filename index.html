          <h1> Hello! I'm Jay Hahn </h1>
          <p class="paragraph">
          I was born and raised in Southern California, and I went to an arts high school specializing in Culinary Arts & Hospitality. I really enjoy baking and cooking.

          These are some of the projects I've done! I've made three food service pop-ups, and they were named Hae, Farmer's Market, and Sakura.

          I really enjoy taking pictures in my free time on my phone:
